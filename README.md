### What I learned
The main objective of this project was to get hands-on experience by working with `NextJS`. The Nextjs is React Based framework with server side rendering capability. It is very fast and SEO friendly.. I have  gained a lot of knowledgeÂ by working with `getStaticProps` which can be used to fetch data and pass data as props of the page so that page can render accordings to passed props.
getStaticProps() function runs at build time in production and runs for every request in dev mode. `File based routing` was another good experience on nextjs.
